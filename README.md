## Readme First
This repository includes de Ip called Spacefibrelight. It was developped by Elsys Deign under a CNES R&D program. The main objective of this IP is :
- To provide an optimized (in ressource) implementation of the spacefibre standard (ECSS-E-ST-50-11C – SpaceFibre – Very high-speed serial link )
- To be comptabible with any spacefibre IP even if spacefibrelight IP is not fully compliant with the standard
- To be operational on Xilinx edge versal (tested on VEK280 evalboard ) and also on Nanoxplore NG-Ultra NG-Ultra300 devices.
- To be opensource
- To be addaptable (that is to say, with additionnal development this IP could be fully compliant to ECSS standard) 


## Introduction

### 1.1 Overview

The SpaceFibre Light IP is compatible with the ECSS-E-ST-50-11C SpaceFibre standard, but do not include all the features.
This IP has been designed to be as technologically independent as possible. 

That's why it contains only two dependent technology IPs:
- HSSL IP from Xilinx-AMD
- BufGT for the clock outgoing from this HSSL IP

This IP was developed on a Xilinx-AMD Versal VEK280 Evaluation Platform with FMC Connector (Versal AI Edge xcve2802-vsvh1760-2MP-e-S) with vivado 2024.1

The figure shows the block diagram of the SpaceFibre Light IP.

 The SpaceFibre Light IP can be used in several layers:
 -  One access to the Lane layer via Injector and Spy.
 -  One access to the Data Link layer with AXI-Stream buses for each virtual channel.

 The current IP is composed of a configurable 1 to 8 virtual channels and 1 Broadcast channel.

### 1.2 Features

- Up to 8 AXI4-Stream 32b interface data inputs and outputs from Data Link layer
- AXI4-Stream 32b interface broadcast inputs and outputs from Data Link layer
- Custom 32b interface data input and output from Lane layer, activatable
- Discrete signals interface for configuration
- Multiple discrete signals for external QoS computing
- Multiple discrete signals for external error management
- 6 Gbit/s data rate
- Encapsulation and decapsulation of data according to SpaceFibre protocol
- Link management
- Virtual channels physical media access management
- Lane management
- 8b/10b encoding and decoding

### 1.2 Unsupported features from the SpaceFibre standard

- Network layer: 
    - All the features
- Data-Link layer: 
    - QoS features
    - Error management features

## 2 Specification
### 2.1 Clock domains
### 2.1.1 Clock domain: CLK
The first clock domain corresponds to the system clock (150 MHz). The Data-Link layer, Injector and Spy are
synchronized on this clock.
### 2.1.2 Clock domain: CLK_GTY
The second clock domain is the GTY clock. It is the input clock of the Xilinx GTY IP (100
MHz).

### 2.1.3 Clock domain: CLK_TX
The third clock domain is generated by the GTY transceiver IP. The Phy+Lane layer is
synchronized on this clock domain. (150 MHz)

### 2.1.4 Clock domain: AXIS_CLK_TX
The fourth clock domain is the AXI4S clock on the TX flow. (150 MHz)

### 2.1.5 Clock domain: AXIS_CLK_RX
The fifth clock domain is the AXI4S clock on the RX flow. (150 MHz)

## 3 How to Use

### 3.1 Functional Description

The SpaceFibre Light IP is separated in two layers: the Data Link layer and the Phy + Lane layer.  

The Data Link layer is responsible for the encapsulation and decapsulation fo data and allocate the access to the Physical Medium between 8 virtual channels and a broadcast channel.  
The Phy + Lane layer is responsible for the initialization of the lane through the Physical Medium, the management of the lane, the 8b/10b encoding and decoding of data and the management of the Physical Medium.  
  
Each layer can be used as a data input and output, depending of the configuration of the IP.
  
#### 3.1.1 Lane Layer Interface

During the initialisation procedure (specified in §3.2.3), the discrete signals ENABLE_INJ and ENABLE_SPY must be asserted.  
  
The data are injected and received directly from the Lane layer, bypassing virtual channel management, encapsulation and decapsulation.  

The interface to transmit data through the Physical Medium is the Injector interface, composed of LANE_RESET_INJ, CAPABILTY_TX_INJ, DATA_TX_INJ, NEW_DATA_TX_INJ, VALID_K_CHARAC_TX_INJ and FIFO_TX_FULL_INJ.

DATA_TX_INJ is composed of 32 bits which represent the data to be transmitted next. VALID_K_CHARAC_TX_INJ represents the D/K flags for each byte of DATA_TX_INJ. Each flag is asserted if the corresponding byte of data represents a K character, is de-asserted if it represents a D character. The byte correspondence of VALID_K_CHARAC_TX_INJ is described in the following figure:  

![](doc/assets/Lane_layer_interface_TX.png)  
  
NEW_DATA_TX_INJ must be asserted when VALID_K_CHARAC_TX_INJ and DATA_TX_INJ are valid, and if FIFO_TX_FULL_INJ is de-asserted. The data is then considered written and the next data can be treated.  
LANE_RESET_INJ is the equivalent of the LaneReset command from the Data Link layer in the Lane layer. It has the same effect as the LANE_RESET signal.  
CAPABILTY_TX_INJ is the value of the Capability byte to be inserted in the INIT3 control word. The value of the bit 1 corresponding to the INIT3LaneStart flag will be overwritten by the Lane layer according to the current configuration.  

The interface to receive data from the Physical Medium is the Spy interface, composed of FIFO_RX_RD_EN_SPY, DATA_RX_SPY, FIFO_RX_DATA_VALID_SPY, VALID_K_CHARAC_RX_SPY and FIFO_RX_EMPTY_SPY.

DATA_RX_SPY is composed of 32 bits which represent the last received data. VALID_K_CHARAC_RX_SPY represents the D/K flags for each byte of DATA_RX_SPY. Each flag is asserted if the corresponding byte of data represents a K character, is de-asserted if it represents a D character. The byte correspondence of VALID_K_CHARAC_RX_SPY is described in the following figure:  

![](doc/assets/Lane_layer_interface_RX.png)  
  
FIFO_RX_DATA_VALID_SPY must be asserted for VALID_K_CHARAC_RX_SPY and DATA_RX_SPY to be valid. To read a new value, FIFO_RX_RD_EN_SPY must be asserted. The new data to read will be available on the next clock rising edge. FIFO_RX_EMPTY_SPY being asserted indicate that no data are available.  
  
#### 3.1.2 Data Link Layer Interface

During the initialisation procedure (specified in §3.2.3), the discrete signals ENABLE_INJ and ENABLE_SPY must be de-asserted.   

The data are sent and received from the Data Link layer interfaces, which are 32 bits AXI4-Stream interfaces. There are up to 8 Data Virtual Channels and 1 Broadcast Virtual Channel available.  
  
The 4 bits signal TUSER of the AXI4-Stream interfaces is used to transmit the D/K flags for each byte of the word transmitted. It is asserted for K character and de-asserted for D character

![](doc/assets/Data_Link_layer_interface.png)  
  
For data format, the packets are ended with an EOP (K29.7) or EEP (K30.7). They can be separated with FILL (K27.7) to maintain data alignment.  
  
![](doc/assets/Data_Link_data_format.png)  

For broadcast format, the packets have a fixed size of 2 words of 32 bits.  
  
The CURRENT_TIME_SLOT_NW signal is an 8 bit value representing the current time-slot for the QoS. This signal might be used only if QoS is computed externally.  
  
The CONTINUOUS_VC is used to activate the continuous mode on the different data virtual channels TX. When activated, the data can always be written to the virtual channel, but if the output buffer overflows, it is flushed and an EEP (K30.7) is inserted. Then the next data are discarded until an EOP or EEP is sent, indicating the start of a new packet. This mode is used when receiving the most recent data is more important than missing one.  
  

#### 3.1.3 QoS discrete Signal Interface

The QoS discrete signal interface is composed of multiple status to allow an external computing of channel priority:
- FRAME_FINISHED
- FRAME_TX
- DATA_COUNTER_TX
- DATA_COUNTER_RX
- ACK_COUNTER_TX
- ACK_COUNTER_RX
- NACK_COUNTER_TX
- NACK_COUNTER_RX
- FCT_COUNTER_TX
- FCT_COUNTER_RX
- FULL_COUNTER_RX
- RETRY_COUNTER_RX
- DATA_PULSE_RX
- ACK_PULSE_RX
- NACK_PULSE_RX
- FCT_PULSE_RX
- FULL_PULSE_RX
- RETRY_PULSE_RX
- CURRENT_TIME_SLOT

The counters are incremented and the pulses are asserted when the corresponding type of word is received or transmitted.  
  
The PAUSE_VC 9 bits are then used to pause the corresponding channel, including the broadcast channel. By piloting PAUSE_VC, it is then possible to apply the priority which as being computed externally.


#### 3.1.4 Error Management discrete Signal Interface

The Error Management discrete signal interface is composed of multiple status to allow external error diagnostic and error management:  
- SEQ_NUMBER_TX
- SEQ_NUMBER_RX
- CREDIT_VC
- INPUT_BUF_OVF_VC
- FCT_CREDIT_OVERFLOW
- CRC_LONG_ERROR
- CRC_SHORT_ERROR
- SEQUENCE_ERROR
- FRAME_ERROR
- NACK_SEQ_NUM
- ACK_SEQ_NUM

Depending on the implementation of external error management, multiple strategies are available on reception of a NACK control word.  
When NACK_RST_EN is de-asserted, nothing is done on NACK reception, as it is supposed to be managed externally. When asserted, a Link Reset procedure is required automatically for NACK reception. This Link Reset procedure is delayed until the end of the current packet being received if NACK_RST_MODE is de-asserted. 

### 3.2 IP Integration
#### 3.2.1 Clocking and reset

There are 20 clocks to provide to the SpaceFibre Light IP. There are 2 clocks needed for the different layers of the IP, and 18 clocks to be provided for the 9 AXI4-Stream Master interfaces and 9 AXI4-Stream Slave interfaces:  

- CLK: This clock is associated with the first clock domain and corresponds to the system clock. It must be at 150 MHz. The Data-Link layer discrete signals, the Lane layer Injector interface and the Lane layer Spy interface are synchronized with this clock.
- CLK_GTY: This clock is the input clock of the Xilinx GTY IP and must be at 100 MHz.
- AXIS_ACLK_TX_DL : This vector is composed of the 9 AXI4-Stream Master clocks. Each interface AXI4-Stream of the TX interface is synchronized with its corresponding clock, which must be provided with a frequency of 150 MHz.
- AXIS_ACLK_RX_DL : This vector is composed of the 9 AXI4-Stream Slave clocks. Each interface AXI4-Stream of the RX interface is synchronized with its corresponding clock, which must be provided with a frequency of 150 MHz.

To generate the CLK_GTY clock, a reference clock must be used through the Gigabit Transceiver Buffer IBUFDS_GTE5 primitive.  
  

**Generics of `IBUFDS_GTE5_I`**

| Name                | Value | 
|---------------------|-------|
| REFCLK_EN_TX_PATH   | '0'   |
| REFCLK_ICNTL_RX     | 0     |
| REFCLK_HROW_CK_SEL  | 0     |
  
   

**Ports of `IBUFDS_GTE5_I`**

| Name | Connected to            | Note                                 |
|------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| O    | CLK_GTY                  | Output                               |
| I    | QUAD0_GTREFCLK0_in_p    | Differential input (positive)        |
| IB   | QUAD0_GTREFCLK0_in_n    | Differential input (negative)        |
| CEB  | '0'                     | Clock buffer enable (active low)     |


One clock is provided by the SpaceFibre Light IP:
  
- CLK_TX: This clock is generated by the GTY transceiver IP at 150 MHz. The Phy layer and Lane layer discrete signals are synchronized with this clock. 
  
Different reset signals are available on the SpaceFibre Light IP:  
  
- RST_N: Main reset signal, active-low and asynchronous. A pulse is needed to activate the reset of the GTY IP.
- LANE_RESET: Reset signal of the Phy and Lane layers, synchronized with CLK_TX, active high. This signal activates the lane reset procedure.
- LANE_RESET_INJ: Reset signal of the Phy and Lane layers, synchronized with CLK, active high. This signal activates the lane reset procedure. This signal is dependant of the ENABLE_INJ signal.
- LINK_RESET: Reset signal of the Phy, Lane and Data Link layers, synchronized with CLK, active high. This signal activates the Link Reset procedure and the lane reset procedure.
- INTERFACE_RESET: Reset signal of the Phy, Lane and Data Link layers, synchronized with CLK, active high. This signal activates the Link Reset procedure and the lane reset procedure and assert the RESET_PARAM signal.
- AXIS_ARSTN_TX_DL : This vector is composed of the 9 AXI4-Stream Master reset signals. Each interface AXI4-Stream of the TX interface is reset by its corresponding reset signals, which is active low and asynchronous.
- AXIS_ARSTN_RX_DL : This vector is composed of the 9 AXI4-Stream Slave reset signals. Each interface AXI4-Stream of the RX interface is reset by its corresponding reset signals, which is active low and asynchronous.

Some output signals are provided by the SpaceFibre Light IP to control external signals:
- RST_TXCLK_N: Reset synchronous with CLK_TX, active low. This signal is an output of the IP and is active when a reset of the Phy and Lane layers is required. It is maintained active until the Phy layer reset is completed.
- RESET_PARAM: Reset synchronous with CLK, active high. This signal is an output of the IP and is active when a reset of the configuration signals of the SPACEFIBRE IP is required. 

#### 3.2.2 Constraints

This paragraph includes the constraints to be set by the end-user for the IP the be properly integrated in the final design.
To implement the SpaceFibre Light IP, you have to select the right GTY ports. To do so, follow the procedure below:

### 4.3 Improvments

### 4.4 Known issues


#### 4.4.1 ACK/NACK Error management issue with Data Link polarity flag TX

ACK and NACK transmitted allow to acknowledge the good or bad reception of a frame. The corresponding frame is identified thanks to a sequence_number on 7 bits and a polarity flag. The value of those signals are computed by the Data Link during transmission and added to the encapsulation of the frame.
ACK and NACK are considered valid and to be acknowledged when the polarity flag they are associated with is of the same value of the one in the current transmission chain. If they are not valid, they are simply discarded.  
  
The polarity flag of the transmission chain changes its value when and only when an error recovery operation is started. But this functionality is not implemented in the SpaceFibre Light IP as it is supposed to be implemented externally. Thus, an error recovery operation cannot be started, and the polarity flag is stuck in its initial value, which is positive.  
This leads to a functional problem: if a NACK is received when the NACK_RST_EN is de-asserted, then the communication is blocked as an error recovery operation is expected by the far-end system but cannot be performed by the near-end system. An external control of the sequence_number and the of the polarity flag in transmission would be required to overcome this issue.  
Because of this limitation, the behaviour of the SpaceFibre Light IP couldn't be tested with a valid negative polarity flag in an ACK or a NACK being received, the context required for them to be considered valid being impossible to reach.  
  
  
#### 4.4.2 Delayed Link Reset procedure on NACK reception unsupported

The functionality of the NACK_RST_EN and NACK_RST_MODE signals is to provide the following scenarios :

| NACK_RST_EN | NACK_RST_MODE  | Description                           |
|-------------|----------------|---------------------------------------|
| 0           | 0              | No action in case of NACK reception   |
| 0           | 1              | No action in case of NACK reception   |
| 1           | 0              | Link Reset after NACK reception       |
| 1           | 1              | After NACK reception, wait to empty input buffers  then Link Reset |

The IP does not currently support the scenario where NACK_RST_MODE and NACK_RST_EN are both asserted. If NACK_RST_EN is asserted, a Link Reset is performed as soon as a NACK is received. Otherwise, the reception of a NACK does not require any particular procedure.
The current status is as follows:

| NACK_RST_EN | NACK_RST_MODE  | Description                           |
|-------------|----------------|---------------------------------------|
| 0           | 0              | No action in case of NACK reception   |
| 0           | 1              | No action in case of NACK reception   |
| 1           | 0              | Link Reset after NACK reception       |
| 1           | 1              | Link Reset after NACK reception       |

#### 4.4.3 Possible Robustness Issue

When running several physical tests in a row on the DATALINK layer, some tests initially considered PASS might end up being FAIL. This doesn't prevent from running conclusive (PASS) tests afterwards, even the one who ended up being FAIL.
This error can be caused by a number of factors:
- Software mismanagement
- Errors in RTL generator and analyzer models
- Error coming from the IP itself

#### 4.4.3 Unitary RTL tests
Unit tests existed on the original code, but have not been updated.
The unit tests must therefore be checked and corrected if necessary.
