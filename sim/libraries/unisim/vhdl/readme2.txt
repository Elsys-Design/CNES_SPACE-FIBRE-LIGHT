The *Common Libraries* folder
=============================

To add reusable libraries to your project:

1. Drag your HDL files or folders into this folder.
2. Right-click on them, and select *Set Library > \[choose the library name\]*

*Notes*: 
* The more files/libraries you add, the more sources Sigasi Studio has to process.
  So if possible, only include *package* and *component* declarations.  
* Files in *Common Libraries* are supposed to be error free.
  Sigasi Studio will not check for errors or warnings in these files.
